	<h1>IT CAN ONLY GETS BETTER</h1> 
	<p>He laid on his bed, groaning and waiting for the pain to cease. The ailment had defied all the treatments that were made available. His wife stood at the corner, helplessly watching, and not knowing how to help him. She didn't know what to lament- the loss of their children, the damage to their sources of income or a husband whose body was covered with sores. How can all these bad things happen to only one person at the same time? For all it's worth, where is the God my husband faithfully worshipped and served all these years? she thought.</p>
	<p>Looking intently at his wife, the sick man wondered what she was thinking. "Whatever it is you are thinking about, it must be very unpleasant. Your thoughts are written all over your face," he said loudly.</p>
	<p>Startled by his voice, she snapped out of her thought and sighed deeply. "I was just thinking about all that has befallen us. Looks like God has abandoned us," she responded.</p>
	<p>"No my dear, you can't say that," he refuted. <b>"No matter what has happened, I know without doubt that God cares about us, and that He-</b>"</p>
	<p>"Please, spare me that poetry of yours," she interjected. "If He really cares about us, why did He allow these misfortunes. Using a pleading tone, she said to him, "Look my husband, I can't bear to see you like this. Curse this God and put an end to your misery."</p>
	<p>Disappointed, he shook his head slowly and replied, "You speak like one of those foolish women out there. Is it possible to enjoy good things from God and not expect some trying times? I know God is aware of my situation, and He will never leave me helpless or comfortless. Anyway, whatever He allows to befall me, I will never drift away from Him." His wife shrugged her shoulders in exasperation and walked away.</p>
